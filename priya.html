   <h2>History</h2>
   <p><b> Moses </b> has often been portrayed in Christian art and literature, for instance in <i> Michelangelo's Moses </i> and in works at a number of <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> government.<br><br> In the medieval and Renaissance period, he is frequently shown as having small horns, as the result of a mistranslation in the Latin Vulgate bible, which nevertheless at times could reflect Christian ambivalence or have overtly antisemitic connotations.</p>
